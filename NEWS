    --- The installation process has been standardized as
        it should be for a GNU package.

    --- A scripting language has been implemented which allows
        the user to define his/her own neural network without
        having to go through the source code.
        Plenty of options are now possible, for instance, the
        user can define the number of neurons, their connections,
        their discriminant, activation functions, etc.
        The user can choose among four different methods for
        training the neural network which can be saved for
        later use.

    --- Some part of the code have been optimized to run faster.

    --- A test folder has been created containing a commented
        example of script which defines a neural network for
        a simple curve fitting task.
